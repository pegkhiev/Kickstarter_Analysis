## An Analysis of Kickstarter Projects for Louise's Kickstarter Campaign 

**1. Background**

Louise estimated a budget of US$10,000+ to fund her new campaign, a Play named "Fever", on Kickstarter.  She wanted to understand more the factors that would help to make a project campaign more successful. 

**2. Initial Analysis**

a) In the Theater category (which includes Musicals, Plays, and Spaces) in US, 525 out of 912 projects (57.6%) were successful.

c) For all Plays projects in US, the successful projects have a mean goal of $5,049 and a median goal of $3,000; whereas for the failed projects have a higher mean goal of $10,554 and a higher median goal of $5,000.  The successful projects resulted in a mean and median pledged amount fairly similar to the goal; whereas for the failed projects the mean and the median pledged amount is much lower. 

|   |Successful|Failed|
---| --- | ---
Mean Goal | $5,059 | 10,554| 
Median Goal | $3,000 | $5,000| 
---| ---| ---
Mean Pledged | $5,602 | $559|
Median Pledged | $3,168 | $103|

d) Among all Plays projects in US, the upper percentile (75%) of goal and pledged amounts are $5,000 and $5,699 respectively.  Louise's funding target of $10,000+ means that her project will be among the top 25% of Kickstarter Plays projects in US. 

|   |Successful|Failed|
---| --- | ---
Mean Goal | $5,059 | 10,554| 
Median Goal | $3,000 | $5,000| 
**Upper Percentile Goal** | **$5,000** | **$10,000**|
---| ---| ---
Mean Pledged | $5,602 | $559|
Median Pledged | $3,168 | $103|
**Upper Percentile Pledged** | **$5,699** | **$501**|

Note: Louise was also interested in project outcomes for musicals in UK, but they will not be discussed here. 

**3. Initial Conclusion** 

Louise's Kickstarter campaign for Plays in the US will have a higher chance of success over musicals, and her funding goal of US$10,000 puts her Kickstarter campaign in the top 25% of all Kickstarter "Plays" projects in the US.
